Glucagon, which also plays a central role in glucose homeostasis, is produced in response to low normal glucose levels or hypoglycemia and acts to increase glucose levels by accelerating glycogenolysis and promoting gluconeogenesis

After a glucose-containing meal, however, glucagon secretion is inhibited by hyperinsulinemia
