Riesgos de la vitamina B6:
	·"I know that b6 overdose is a real risk and it can cause neuropathy" 
		>> "most will considera 50mg too high of a daily dose, i think 10-25 mg is a safer range"
		>> the risk of overdose is due to the pirodoxine versions; pirodoxal (P5P) is animal b6 and is not goingo to give issues like pirodoxine. 25 mg is enough.
		>> Swanson do a version with 20mg p5p.
	·Its important to measure riboflavin as FAD before you take any b6. Brainfog is often a resulto of lacking magnesium, therefore you should measure it.
	·"the intestine only absorbs nonphosphorylated b6 vitamers (...) for it to enter the brain, it must dissociate from albumin to be dephosphorylated to pyridoxal"
	·can be tricky, even 1mg can cause problems right away for some people
	·Síntomas para saber si no es indicado para ti: nerve activity buzzing / zapping, sleep disruption.
	·"It seems that most that have the b6 problem have joint hypermobility / other connective tissue issues"
	
Más consideraciones sobre suplementación:
	·Builds up in body, you don't have to take daily.
	·[[Ray Peat]] has recommended 10 mg per day of p5p. Peat no los recomienda para uso constante, solo para tratar problemas específicos.
	·Load & Slow, start really low, see how your body responds.
