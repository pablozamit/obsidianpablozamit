Vignatex is an innovative combination of a) mung bean b) passionflower

"Â this product is in my opinion the best dopaminergic boost to combine with Cognance. It is long lasting, smooth, extremely uplifting, balanced, and not edgy at all. The combo of 5-HT2A PAM and MAOI-B inhibition brings one a very deep sense of focus and a strong undercurrent of creative brain ðŸ§  energy."

While Passionflower also inhibits MAO, it mainly works to smooth out any potential jitters via enhancing GABAergic activity
