# Introducción

El bicarbonato de sodio (NaHCO3) puede incrementar tus niveles de [[Testosterona]], el rendimiento deportivo y sensibilizar los [[receptores de andrógenos]] a través de la vía [[cAMP]] > PKA (?).

El cAMP estimula la producción de una enzima llamada PKA (proteína cinasa A), que regula el metabolismo del glucógeno, el azúcar las grasas dentro de los receptores de andrógenos. Hay evidencia que sugiere que niveles altos de PKA pueden aumentar la sensibilidad de estos receptores, y por tanto el uso de hormonas andrógenas.

# Efecto ergogénico 

El bicarbonato de socio es un búfer del pH, haciendo que tus músculos sean más alcalinos durante el entrenamiento, aumentando en consecuencia el uso de oxígeno y por tanto el rendimiento y la fuerza.


[[Ray Peat]] sobre el bicarbonato:

"carbonated water, or “soda water,” should improve circulation to the brain when the brain’s production of [[CO2|carbon dioxide]]   wasn’t adequate" (...) "A week later, a student said she had gone home that night and (interpreting soda water as bicarbonate of soda in water) given her stroke-paralyzed mother a glass of water with a spoonful of baking soda in it. Her mother had been hemiplegic for 6 months following a stroke, but 15 minutes after drinking the bicarbonate, the paralysis lifted, and she remained normal. Later, a man who had stroke-like symptoms when he drank alcohol late at night, found that drinking a glass of carbonated water caused the symptoms to stop within a few minutes."

"[[Hipotiroidismo|low thyroid]] people produce little carbon dioxide (...) Carbon dioxide (breathing in a bag, or drinking [[Agua con gas o carbonatada|carbonated water]], or bathing in water with baking soda) followed by thyroid supplementation, would be the appropriate therapy for this type of functional ischemia of the brain".

**Testimonio del foro de [[Ray Peat]]**

"I'm on about day 5 now of taking 3 separate teaspoon (4g) doses a day for a total of 12 gr (...) The way I use the baking soda is mixing 1 tsp with 2 TABLESPOONS of apple cider vinegar which I then mix with a cup of water - does this cancel out a CO2 benefit since the reaction is happening before I ingest it or does it still contain a good amount of CO2? Could it be primarily the sodium helping me, either via metabolism or direct antibiotic effect? Is it the alkalization? 

"I would say between meals describes the majority of doses"
"Haidut posted a study of baking soda (about 2 grams a day) helping on rheumatoid arthritis"
"Baking soda is [[Inflamación|anti-inflammatory]]"

"If you’re wanting to get the bicarbonate into your body you probably want to take it when the volume of stomach acid is low (between meals)."

"Since haidut's post on baking soda, I've added it to all my orange juice daily. Sometimes I also add whey protein to that orange juice, and sip it during a work day, or chug it post workout. That post was about 1 week ago.  
  
In that last 1 week, my temperatures have been sky high. I'm always boiling hot. I believe this to be high carbon dioxide, as an old member named vision of strength described high CO2 as creating a very warm body temperature, among other beneficial things that Im also experiencing."

I missed the part with mixing baking soda with vinegar, which really changes the baking soda into sodium acetate, partly or entirely of which I can't be certain of. Thanks.

I've done both. I am sure the effects are somewhat different. When reacted with ACV you are primarily getting [[Acetato de sodio|sodium acetate]].

"Mark Sircus's book "Sodium Bicarbonate: Nature's Unique First Aid Remedy" gives a solid explanation for why baking soda works. [https://www.amazon.com/Sodium-Bicarbonate-Natures-Unique-Remedy/dp/075700394X](https://www.amazon.com/Sodium-Bicarbonate-Natures-Unique-Remedy/dp/075700394X)  
  
Two key quotes from the book: 1) "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) immediately reacts when it mixes with stomach acid. NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + H20 + CO2. That is: Sodium bicarbonate + stomach acid yields salt + water + carbon dioxide." 2) "According to Henderson, carbon dioxide exerts at least three well-defined influences: 1.It is one of the prime factors in the acid-base balance of the blood. 2.It is the principal control of respiration. 3.It exerts an essential tonic influence upon the heart and peripheral circulation.""

*Posibles efectos secundarios:*
"One potential consequence of excessive prolonged baking soda supplement (not sure if it always requires excessive calcium supplementation too to be a problem), is milk-alkali-syndrome. There are a couple of members here who got into serious trouble with it, and it took a while to recover. At least one (maybe more) involved hospital.  
  
I'm not expert by any means, but personally, if it were me, I would not want my UpH to stay up at 8 for too long, and I'd take it as a possible warning to back off the baking soda, at least until I had better information to guide the decision."

>>we have to understand the circumstances that led to complications in using baking soda. For one, the person has to be healthy enough. Organs such as liver and kidney are working well. The subject also should have a fairly good metabolism, which keeps him from suffering the ill effects of poor calcium balance.
