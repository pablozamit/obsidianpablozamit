Insulin, a potent antilipolytic (inhibiting fat breakdown) hormone, is known to reduce blood glucose levels by accelerating transport of glucose into insulin-sensitive cells and facilitating its conversion to storage compounds via glycogenesis (conversion of glucose to glycogen) and lipogenesis (fat formation).
