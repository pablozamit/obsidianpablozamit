"Careful with megadosing. I stick to seafood/shellfish/crustaceans and eat additional Dulse or kelp."

"i take nascent iodine a drop on the tongue with first meal of the day"

"If you can’t oystermaxx daily, snonch on a couple sheets of nori (seed oil free options can be found at your local Asian grocery)"

"kelp or sea moss. I take 600mg whole thallus kelp from nature way"

"I like J Crow’s. I take about 30 drops per day to keep breaking up those crystals up which has formed around the Pineal Gland! Give it a try!"

"Out of all the nutrients we know the human body requires, iodine is by far the heaviest one with an atomic mass of 127. **The average body only contains 15-20mg** iodine[6](https://wiki.chadnet.org/fluoride-bromine-and-iodine#6) which is the same amount found in **one tablespoon of kelp!**"

"**30% of the body's iodine is found in the thyroid gland.** Most research about iodine focuses on the thyroid for this reason.

**The thyroid hormones are called T3 and T4 because of the number of iodine atoms they contain**

"bromine & fluoride will inhibit your cells from absorbing iodine[7](https://wiki.chadnet.org/fluoride-bromine-and-iodine#7) thereby increasing our demand for iodine."

pesticides inhibits iodine

"Sodium Chloride and a tiny amount of Potassium Iodide. Since chlorine is also a halogen, it will compete with the iodine making this literally the worst way of supplementing iodine one could think of"

"A study on thyroiditis found that the **fluoride levels in your drinking water was twice as important** as whether you had a family history of thyroiditis..![10](https://wiki.chadnet.org/fluoride-bromine-and-iodine#10)"

"It was recently proven that **iodine is an antioxidant**[12](https://wiki.chadnet.org/fluoride-bromine-and-iodine#12)"

"**However, the seaweed isn't all you need: iodine in isolation is toxic for you.** If you would eat a ton of seaweed, you would feel bad. The way to do it is to eat a tiny, tiny pinch of kelp daily, make sure you are getting enough co-factors (selenium and magnesium most importantly) and slowly increase the kelp dose as long as you feel good."

**Iodine can remove Fluoride & Bromine from your body!** (...) **when you take a large dose of iodine, then your body will be flooded with toxic bromine & flouride that were dumped out from the cells.**

Un buen protocolo sería: [[Algas|algas]] + [[Nueces de Brasil]].
