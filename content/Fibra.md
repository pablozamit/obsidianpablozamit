## Fibra soluble / insoluble

"Many benefit from insoluble fiber (raw carrot). I think this is due to the pro-motility effect, and that they lower the bacterial load over time. However, insoluble fiber works as an irritant."

"Natural laxatives like coffee are helpful for alleviating constipation, as well as ensuring adequate magnesium intake. Gentler antibacterials like raw honey, white button mushrooms, coconut oil and mastic can be beneficial."
