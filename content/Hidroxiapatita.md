Hydroxyapatite vs. Flouride We have been using Boka toothpaste(with hydroxyapatite) which is supposed to be as effective as flouride and is non-toxic. We have been happy with it. Our teeth have definitely improved but are not perfect.

namel is about 98% hydroxyapatite, while the dentin is about 70% hydroxyapatite and rest collagen/water. So ideally hydroxyapatite could perhaps help both heal,
