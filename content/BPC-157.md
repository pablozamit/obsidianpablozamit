BPC-157 has been shown to:

- _[Promote tendon and ligament healing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21030672) by tendon outgrowth, cell survival, and cell migration in a rodent model of Achilles tendon rupture, and also [when administered in drinking water to rats with damaged medial collateral ligaments](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20225319)_
- _[Tendon-to-bone healing effective enough that they may actually “successfully exchange the present reconstructive surgical methods”](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jor.20096/abstract)_
- _[Counter the damaging effects of NSAIDs like ibuprofen or advil](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22950504) on the gut lining so effectively that scientists termed BPC-157 “a NSAIDs antidote” one of which they say that “[no other single agent has portrayed a similar array of effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22950504)“_
- _[Repair the damage from inflammatory bowel disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17713731) (IBD) within just days of oral administration in a rodent model of IBD_
- _[Help cure periodontitis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20388954) when administered in a rodent model of periodontitis, significantly enough to have scientists conclude that “[BPC 157 may represent a new peptide candidate in the treatment of periodontal disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20388954)“_
- _[Reverse systemic corticosteroid-impaired muscle healing](http://www.medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/878454), in rodent models where BPC-157 was administered orally once daily for 14 days to rats with crushed gastrocnemius muscle. Similar benefits were demonstrated in a rodent study by Novinscak et al._
- _Accelerate bone healing in rabbits who [suffered segmental bone defect before being treated with BPC-157](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10071911) ._
