# Usos y beneficios

## Eliminación de metales pesados

"Niacin causes a “Rebound Lipolysis” first described when studied in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia – this vitamin first tries to prevent lipolysis (for about 2 hours) and then it rebounds and leads to massive fat cell release of triglycerides and at the same time release of heavy metals from fat cells. This is the reason why its good to combine the protocol with an infrared [[sauna]] and sweating to expel the neurotoxins" (no verificado, Ray Peat Forum)
## Como terapia para reparar la [[Barrera intestinal]]

"I think a reasonable protocol would be to take 30mg/kg on weekends (2 days), maybe twice a month, as a general prophylactic and/or gut-repair regimen. A daily dose of 200mg-300mg would probably have similar beneficial effects as the larger doses taken sporadically. Several human studies already demonstrated that a daily dose of 300mg niacinamide raises NAD levels to the same degree as 1,000mg daily.

"...**The permeability of the epithelial intestinal barrier is known to increase with age. The resulting condition, also known as “leaky gut,”** can be exacerbated by dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors, such as alcohol consumption [2]. While not lethal, like cancer or cardiovascular diseases, **leaky gut is not a trifling matter**. Recent studies have shown that intestinal contents, such as the bacterial byproduct **lipopolysaccharide**, become potent immune system triggers in the bloodstream. **This is how a leaky gut causes inflammaging: the persistent systemic inflammation that drives multiple diseases of aging** [3]."  
  
"...In this new study, the researchers investigated the **deleterious effects of ethanol on gut permeability** in mice and whether they can be alleviated by NR. Over the course of the experiment, mice fed an ethanol-rich diet experienced intestinal barrier deterioration. However, in mice **who also received NR, this effect, as measured by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration in serum, was largely abolished**."  
  
"...Recent studies show that energy homeostasis is important for tight junction formation between intestinal epithelial cells [6]. The researchers confirmed that **NAD+ levels were greatly depleted in those cells by ethanol, but elevated by NR supplementation – amazingly, above those of healthy controls**. **Levels of [[ATP]]**, the molecule considered cellular “energy currency”, **showed a similar dynamic**."  
  
"...Since most of the energy production in cells occurs in mitochondria, the researchers also analyzed mitochondrial health. As expected, **levels of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and citrate synthase (CS), two functional mitochondrial enzymes, were reduced by ethanol but rescued by NR supplementation. Same picture was observed for mitochondrial DNA number**."

## Como protocolo de desintoxicación incluyendo [[Sauna]]


# Testimonios

"I used niacin for years and rather enjoyed the flush effect and the [[GABA]] rush afterwards. But not until Peat did I understand what was happening and stopped.  
The histamine spike is just the beginning of the damage"

# Notas sueltas

El enrojecimiento facial es el efecto secundario más comúnmente informado. Dura aproximadamente 15-30 minutos y algunas veces es acompañado por una sensación de prurito o picazón. Este efecto es mediado por [prostaglandinas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandina "Prostaglandina") y puede ser bloqueado con la ingestión de 300 mg de [[Aspirina (ácido acetilsalicílico)]] una hora antes de ingerir la niacina.
