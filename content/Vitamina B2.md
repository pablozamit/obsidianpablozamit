Riboflavina

It is essential to the formation of two major [coenzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme "Coenzyme"), [flavin mononucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_mononucleotide "Flavin mononucleotide") and [flavin adenine dinucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide "Flavin adenine dinucleotide"). These coenzymes are involved in energy [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), [cellular respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration "Cellular respiration"), and [antibody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody "Antibody") production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of [niacin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin_(nutrient) "Niacin (nutrient)"), [vitamin B6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6 "Vitamin B6"), and [folate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate "Folate"). Riboflavin is [prescribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug "Prescription drug") to treat [corneal thinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_ectatic_disorders "Corneal ectatic disorders"), and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of [migraine headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine_headache "Migraine headache") in adults.

any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly [excreted in urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(pharmacology) "Clearance (pharmacology)"), causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint.

[Redox reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox "Redox") are processes that involve the [transfer of electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transfer "Electron transfer"). The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by [archeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), bacterial and fungal [genomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome")) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#cite_note-ods-3)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#cite_note-PKIN2020B2-5) FAD is also required for the activity of [glutathione reductase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_reductase "Glutathione reductase"), an essential enzyme in formation of the [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny_(biology) "Endogeny (biology)") [antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant "Antioxidant"), [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione "Glutathione").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#cite_note-lpi-10)
