"This is what I have done myself to obtain calcium from eggshells for the past four years and I have not gotten sick or died. I rinse off the eggshells and put them to dry. Once I have a good amount, I bake them in the oven for 10 min at 200 degrees. Once they cool off, I pulverize them in a blender at the finest grit possible."

"To prepare the powder, you can wash out the membrane from the inside of the eggshells, store them until you have around ten or a dozen, and then bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Afterward, grind the shells into a powder using an electric coffee grinder. Taking about half a teaspoon of this powder per day, or approximately a quarter teaspoon three times a day, will provide you with over 2,000 milligrams of calcium."
