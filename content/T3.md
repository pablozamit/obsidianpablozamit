+Dopamina, -Tyroid Stimulating Hormone:
"The [neurotransmitter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurotransmitter "Learn more about Neurotransmitter from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [[Dopamina|dopamine]] rapidly decreases TSH subunit secretion, possibly as a result of stimulation of [dopamine receptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dopamine-receptor "Learn more about Dopamine Receptor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") present on the surface of anterior pituitary cells.102,103 [Dopamine agonists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dopamine-agonist "Learn more about Dopamine Agonist from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (l-dopa and bromocriptine) and [dobutamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dobutamine "Learn more about Dobutamine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), a beta1 agonist structurally similar to dopamine, have also been shown to decrease [thyrotropin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thyrotropin "Learn more about Thyrotropin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") secretion.104-106 Administration of a single therapeutic dose of a [dopamine antagonist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dopamine-antagonist "Learn more about Dopamine Antagonist from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [metoclopramide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metoclopramide "Learn more about Metoclopramide from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), enhanced TSH secretion.107 The physiologic role of dopamine regulation of TSH has not yet been elucidated, but these studies reflect the many factors that affect circulating TSH levels."

_“The [[Hígado|liver]] provides about 70% of our active thyroid hormone, by converting thyroxine to T3, but it can provide this active hormone only when it has adequate **glucose**.” A waking temperature of less than 97.8 degrees is a sign that your metabolism is lacking (and that thyroid conversion isn’t happening like it should)."

"Fructose keeps glucose in the bloodstream and this inhibits cortisol, which is the primary inhibitor of T4-T3 conversion. Basic facts, people."
