"Since haiduts posts about how effective Stearic acid is for a multitude of things, i've been experimenting with organic Cacao Butter. I know it is high in monosaturates also but until I get hold of food grade stearic acid, its the next best thing.  
  
here's some great benefits ive noticed after just 3-4 days:  
  
- reduces my panic attack symptoms completely  
- helps with deeper and better quality sleep  
- amazing cognitive boost and feeling more 'in the moment'  
- definitely feeling belly fat shrinking after taking it  
- combines well with caprylic acid and stops any digestive pain from from the caprylic acid  
- amazing for digestive health and very healthy looking stools etc.  
- palpitations stopped".
