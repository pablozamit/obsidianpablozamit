Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are proteins or lipids that become glycated after exposure to sugars.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are modifications of proteins or lipids that become nonenzymatically glycated and oxidized after contact with aldose sugars.

AGEs contribute to a variety of microvascular and macrovascular complications through the formation of cross-links between molecules in the basement membrane of the extracellular matrix and by engaging the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).

AGE-bound RAGE increases endothelial permeability to macromolecules. AGEs block nitric oxide activity in the endothelium and cause the production of reactive oxygen species.

### AGE Biochemistry

Key factors crucial to the formation of AGEs include 
·the rate of turnover of proteins for glycoxidation, 
·the degree of hyperglycemia, and the 
·extent of oxidant stress in the environment.[1,5,8–10](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854#R1-176958)[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854#R5-176958)[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854#R8-176958)[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854#R9-176958)[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.106.621854#R10-176958) If one or more of these conditions is present, both intracellular and extracellular proteins may be glycated and oxidized.

"PUFAs are shown to be 36x worse at this than carbs and it's mainly accumulated PUFAs that accelerate the formation of AGEs"

"Dietary AGEs (formed during cooking) contribute little to none of the AGEs in circulation"
