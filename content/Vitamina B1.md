Tiamina.

Benfotiamina sería la ideal, puesto que la mejor versión, apenas la hay, sería la TTFD. Hay una web que vende Thiamax, para mí el mejor suplemento de B1. Tarda en llegar y es más cara. Pero sabemos que atraviesa la [[Barrera hematoencefálica]] y es ultraefectiva. La benfotiamina es una excelente versión también (Carlos Stro)

Según [[Ray Peat]], combinar B1 + [[Cafeína]] te hará recordar todo.

# Testimonios

1. "Higher body temperature, deeper relaxation, enhanced sleep quality, better motoric balance, a little bit more energy.  
  
For me it only does me good with a 1:1 ratio with magnesium supplementation."


2. "Thiamine was the one B Vitamin that nuked social anxiety, improved mental clarity and made me feel energetic and ultra carb tolerant ??  
Dosages I used was 100-400mg daily"



3. "Thiamine is horrible for me. I think it's analogous to how for some people, serotonin lowering substances like LSD can really bad effects instead of good ones. But other serotonin lowering substances, like coffee and niacinamide, are beneficial for me. It's only thiamine in particular which I think may lower serotonin in a specific way which can magnify hidden negativity"

4. "Id say focus was a big one. Dramatic elevation in my mood. Cognitive improvements, stress alleviation, well being, less anxiety and depression, balaced energy. Even old positive memories was retrieved."


5. I think a lot of people that aren't getting good effects are either using a form other than Thiamine HCL, or taking to much with insufficient carbohydrate, or using an impure source.

6. Uptake of _thiamine_ via the gut is limited by _thiamine_ transport protein TTP1, which is deficient in a lot of people. IV _Thiamine_ injection by pass this bottleneck. A 100mg dose will eliminate all deficiency and blow your head off.
7. Oral absorption of _Thiamine_ is very low as uptake depends on enzymes TTP1 and TTP2. These enzymes are less expressed in a lot of individuals. 50mg of ups _thiamine_ dissolved in water injected with an insulin syringe made of plastic is amazing.
8. You haven't taken _thiamine_ unless you inject it. IV or subcutaneous. You will see the light :)
9. [[Café|Coffee]] has _thiamine_ antagonists blocking carbohydrate metabolism. I had to stop drinking coffee made me to tired. Pur caffeine and coke make no problem at all.

# Contraindicaciones

According to [Dr. Costantini](https://highdosethiamine.org/hdt-therapy/) taking thiamine hcl with juice will cancel out the effect of the thiamine. This was also my experience. I did not experience improvement from thiamine until I started taking it with water only. Tastes terrible but you get used to it.  
  
"**Oral thiamine should not be taken with juices or any sour beverage, water only."**  
  
Coffee and tea block thiamine.
