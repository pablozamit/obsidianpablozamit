Formas de estimularla:

·"El ácido glutámico duplica los niveles de prolactina y [[Cortisol]] en humanos" -> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2574405/. Algunos doctores recomiendan consumir 30gr de [[Glutamina]] por la mañana para reparar la [[Permeabilidad intestinal]]. Glumina + agua = [[Ácido Glutámico]].
	¿Puede la estimulación de los niveles de prolactina ocasionada por el ácido glutámico mejorar el control eyaculatorio?

"# What Do You Do/Take Immediately After Sex/Ejaculation To Reduce Prolactin?"
Those are some things I do/take (if you think they might not be that effective, please voice your opinion(s)):  
  

- Drink 500ml of milk and coffee (calcium to reduce prolactin and coffee increases dopamine)
- Take 200mg theanine (to increase dopamine thus reduce prolactin, also to reduce stress which might help in lowering prolactin)
- Take 10-20mg pregnenolone (to antagonize estrogen from the elevated prolactin and reduced estrogen could lower prolactin in a positive cycle, also to reduce stress which might help in lowering prolactin)
- Take some vitamin A (to reduce prolactin)
- Take zinc picolinate (to reduce prolactin)
- Use red light on the head to target the pituitary gland that produces prolactin

  
Vitamin E (UNIQUE E) seems to make my prolactin higher! which is weird. Maybe there is some trace of soy in it.
