Most people think of graying hair as an unavoidable part of aging. However, we now know that heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic slow down your ability to break down hydrogen peroxide (a bleach) and lead to a gray head of hair.

The truth is that graying hair — as well as other aging symptoms like fatigue, wrinkles, and worsening memory — are often signs of heavy metal toxicity.

If you care about your hair and skin, it’s important your body gets the **vitamins** needed to counteract the damage caused by heavy metals.
