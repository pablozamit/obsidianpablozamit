Dióxido de carbono:

*[[Ray Peat]]* (https://www.functionalps.com/blog/2012/09/26/ray-peat-phd-on-carbon-dioxide-longevity-and-regeneration/):

"El producto final de la respiración es el dióxido de carbono, y es un componente esencial del proceso vital. La habilidad de retener el suficiente CO2 es importante para la longevidad".

"Protege a las células: 1) Uniéndose a grupos amino, inhibiendo la glicación de proteínas durante el estrés oxidativo y limitando la formación de radicales libres; 2) reduce la inflamación causada por endoxotinas ([[lipopolisacáridos]]); 3) protege la mitocondria mejorando su respiración durante el estrés.

Sobre la concentración intrauterina (¿posibles condiciones ideales de CO2?):
"The normal intrauterine level of carbon dioxide is high, and it can be increased or decreased by changes in the mother’s physiology. The effects of carbon dioxide on many biological processes involving methylation and acetylation of the genetic material suggest that the concentration of carbon dioxide during gestation might regulate the degree to which parental imprinting will persist in the developing fetus."

"Carbon dioxide has antioxidant effects, and many other stabilizing actions, including protection against hypoxia and the excitatory effects of intracellular calcium and inflammation (Baev, et al., 1978, 1995; Bari, et al., 1996; Brzecka, 2007; Kogan, et al., 1994; Malyshev, et al., 1995".”"

*Metabolismo, longevidad y CO2*

“Bats have a very high metabolic rate, and an extremely long lifespan for an animal of their size. While most animals of their small size live only a few years, many bats live a few decades. Bat caves usually have slightly more carbon dioxide than the outside atmosphere"

"In beehives, the workers carefully regulate the carbon dioxide concentration, which varies from about 0.2% to 6%, similar to that of the mole rat colony. A high carbon dioxide content activates the ovaries of a queen bee, increasing her fertility".

**A mole rat has never been known to develop cancer.**

"Many of the mysteries of embryology and developmental biology have been explained by the presence of a high level of carbon dioxide during gestation. For example, an injury to the fetus heals without scarring"

"For hundreds or thousands of years, the therapeutic value of carbonated mineral springs has been known." 

[[Ray Peat]] sobre [[Buteyko]]:

"Buteyko devoted his career to showing that sufficient carbon dioxide is important in preventing an exaggerated and maladaptive stress response. He advocated training in “intentional regulation of respiration” (avoiding habitual hyperventilation) to improve oxygenation of the tissues by retaining carbon dioxide. He showed that a deficiency of carbon dioxide (such as can be produced by hyperventilation, or by the presence of lactic acid in the blood) decreases cellular energy (as [[ATP]] and creatine phosphate) and interferes with the synthesis of proteins (including antibodies) and other cellular materials."

"Knowing that hyperventilation can make a person faint, because loss of carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to constrict, I saw that additional carbon dioxide would increase circulation to the brain."

*CO2 y [[Calcio|calcio]]*:

"Keeping an optimal level of carbon dioxide (for example, when adapted to high altitude) causes calcium to be controlled, resulting in lowered parathyroid hormone, an effect similar to supplementing with calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K (Nicolaidou et al, 2006)".
